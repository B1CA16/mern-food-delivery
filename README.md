### Note

If, when you open the website, it shows 'No dishes found.' below 'Find our best dishes', it is likely because the backend is starting up.
Sometimes, if the backend has been inactive for a certain period, it may take a couple of minutes to resume full operation due to the limitations of the free instance on Render.com.
